# typescriptZero

# why we need typescript?
-> detect error without running the code (static type checking)
-> Analyse the code as you type 
-> save some Unit tests as typescript will detect errors while writing the code
-> Every JS code is valid TS code
-> will help you when writing React, Angular, Vue, Node, Express, etc
-> Give you extra features like interfaces, Generics , Decorators, etc

# How Typescript works?
-> Typescript compiler will compile the TS code to JS code "this is called Transpilation"
-> how about the new features that doesn't exist in JS? well, the compiler will make a workaround for that
